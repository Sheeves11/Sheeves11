### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mia Quain. I use Github to share the misc programming projects and games that I make! I have a love for terminal based applications and games, so that's what you'll see me working on most often.

My current project is Untitled Fiefdom Game, which is a text based MMO that takes inspiration from the BBS door games of the late 80s and early 90s.
